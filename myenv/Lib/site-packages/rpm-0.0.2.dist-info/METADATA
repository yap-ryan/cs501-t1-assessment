pypi-rpm
========

Placeholder package to make the RPM Python API available through PyPI.

Right now, this package just reserves the ``rpm`` name on PyPI to avoid
the potential for a name conflict with the ``python2-rpm`` and
``python3-rpm`` Python bindings on RPM-based Linux distros.

Unlike libsolv and libdnf (which use CMake, and are hence amenable to
PyPI compatible build automation with scikit-build), rpm itself still
uses autotools, so creating usable pip-installable Python bindings for
it may be a bit trickier than doing so for the other libraries.
